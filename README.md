Interactive GPU Raytracer
=========================

#Description
A simple interactive GPU raytracer implemented in GLSL.

#Current State
This is an early prototype I wrote in a few hours.
Supports reflection and refraction, though only one per ray-object intersection and to a fixed depth.
Uses skybox to demonstrate effects.
Currently only supports spheres.

#Future Work
I plan to rewrite this using compute shaders after I acquire a newer graphics card.
I will then add support for loaded meshes and will work on global illumination.
